# An AWP Budget Tracker 


# AS AN avid traveler
## I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection

## SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 
## GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection

## WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
## THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

## WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
## THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
